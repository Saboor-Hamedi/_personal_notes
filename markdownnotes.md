# This is my **Personal** notes
---

In this note I will go through things which I need to learn and remember them with the help of my note. 
There will be notes which will be a little confusing for you, which is fine, since this note is personal and aimed to serve my personal needs, I'll try keep them as my personal based understanding.

## 1. Coding
The very **1st** thing I will take note here would be coding. Since I'm learning different languages, such as `python`, `java`, `javascript`, `mysql`, `sql` and few other languages and frameworks like `laravel` I will teach you how to code in session. 

## 2. Vim 
You will find different notes, like `vim` which is my go-to `CLI` or I would say `IDE` which has more functionalities than a typical `IDE`. You can literally customize it.
